			<h1>Welcome to GCC CTF!</h1>
			<p>
			GCCCTF was designed as a fun and friendly event to help Galaxy users,
			developers, and administrators learn more about Galaxy and security.
			</p>
			<p>
			Simultaneously, it is a social activity, intended to help
			bioinformaticians, biologists, and computer scientists to meet one
			another.

		<div class="col-md-4">
			<h2>Who Can Compete</h2>

			<h2>Rules of Engagement</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<b>Please do not compete during presentations</b>. There is
					plenty of time before the conference and during evenings in
					which to work on problems. We ask that you be respectful of
					the presenters.
				</li>
				<li>
					Only hack the Galaxy instance you have been given
					access to. Please do not exploit our infrastructure and
					ruin things for everyone.
